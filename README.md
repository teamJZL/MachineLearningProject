601 Machine Learning Project
============================
Team JZL

./milestones2/ is the Eclipse workspace folder.  
The ./milestone2/src/ contains the .java file which Luigi is currently playing with.  
Currently, Luigi is figuring out how to load and classify the .arff Weka data files.  

Luigi changed the following Eclipse default settings:  
size 12 font instead of size 10  
using "spaces only" instead of using tabs
